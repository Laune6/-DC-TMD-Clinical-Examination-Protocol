In this project the goal was to develop a front-end only DC/TMD Clinical Examination Form web application. The project was modeled after an already existing clinical form (virsu medixine) and an official DC/TMD Examination form (https://app.box.com/s/igdyj7ezl94zwqvte9yus5f482dwek07). Project was made by using html, javascript coding and limesurvey and jotform tools.
Form made by Limesurvey is in finnish and form made by Jotform is in english. Forms include many type of questions, such as sliders, radio buttons etc... Both form tools were free comprehensive and easy to use.
