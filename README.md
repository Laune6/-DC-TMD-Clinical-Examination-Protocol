In this project the goal was to develop a front-end only DC/TMD Clinical Examination Form web application. The project was modeled after an already existing clinical form (virsu medixine) and an official DC/TMD Examination form (https://app.box.com/s/igdyj7ezl94zwqvte9yus5f482dwek07). Project was made by using html, javascript coding and limesurvey and jotform tools.

DC/TMD Examination form was made by simply using html and javascript coding languages. The input fields from the html code are saved to a json object with a javascript. After that a script should read the json object and print a diagnosis but this is still unfinished and requires some more development.

Form made by Limesurvey is in finnish and form made by Jotform is in english. Forms include many type of questions, such as sliders, radio buttons etc... Both form tools were free comprehensive and easy to use.
